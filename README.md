python 2.7 Technical Analisys for financial futures and stocks - made in 2004 and usefull to have a look to solutions adopted

I built this software for my university's thesis and I used for my self to start studing tecnical analisys of financial equities.
It was able to open historical quotes' datas from various sources such as txt file, sqlite DB, metastock files, yahoo and other websites.
It was also able to get real time quotes from a website that it's not working anymore.
It uses many libraries, some of them I made by my self.
